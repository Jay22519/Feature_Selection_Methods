In wrapper methods, we try to use a subset of features and train a model using them. Based on the inferences that we draw from the previous model, we decide to add or remove features from the subset. The problem is essentially reduced to a search problem. These methods are usually computationally very expensive.

Some common examples of wrapper methods are

Forward selection,
Backward elimination,
Exhaustive feature selection,
Recursive feature elimination.
Recursive feature elimination with cross-validation
